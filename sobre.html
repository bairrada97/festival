            Everything started in April 2011, when Zack, Jonathan and Jerome – long-time friends – wanted to organise a group trip to the world famous festival, Coachella.

Does it provide the best value for money?", "Should we go for the VIP ticket or the General Admission one?", and "Should we book local transportation?". The planning and booking process was painful, time consuming and very expensive!
